# Francisca Assuncao Model Preparation for FMdeploy
This GitHub repository contains the code for adapting the "Automatic Segmentation of the Olfactory Bulb" model developed by D. Desser, F. Assunção, X. Yan, V. Alves, H. M. Fernandes, and T. Hummel, as published in the "Brain Sci." journal, Volume 11, Issue 9, August 2021.

The purpose of this adaptation is to integrate the original model with FMdeploy, a machine learning model deployment framework. By adapting the model code and configuration, it can be seamlessly deployed and utilized within the FMdeploy ecosystem.
